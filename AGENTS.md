# Agent Instructions

- Run Python tasks using `uv run` to ensure a managed environment.
- The dataset generator lives in `scripts/generate_dataset.py`.
- Files under `datasets/` are ignored by git except for
  `datasets/sample.jsonl`, which illustrates the format.
- Prefer type hints and docstrings for new Python code.
